## About

This project, called Pixgent, was launched in 2022 by Queaxtra#0034. It was closed for a while with a hosting issue, but on December 25, 2022, at 00:05, the application was reopened.

This application is open source and anyone can use it as they wish. But I want to say something like this. I do not accept responsibility in the event of an incident related to this website.
